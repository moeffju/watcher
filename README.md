# watcher

A super quick and dirty workaround for Google Drive suckage.

Watches the /source directory for changes and syncs them to /destination.

* `watcher.py` uses the `watchdog` library
* `intermittent_watch.py` checks all the filemtimes every interval seconds

Dear Google, please get some UX people and give them power.
